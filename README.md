# GWU_Project.AnalyzingClimateChange
This is a repo for the GWU Intro to Data Science Project 2 that looks at climate change data using R statistical programming. What kind of relationship does temperature and precipitation create? Most of the data comes from the University of Berkeley. The presentation of the analysis runs using a Shiny web application as well as ArcGIS embedded web applications for graphical analysis.
